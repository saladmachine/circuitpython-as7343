AS7343 CircuitPython Library
=============================

7/21/25 After a lot of work and digging I find that the problem with F4 and possibly two other channels has not been fixed. The Micropython library does not fix this problem. There is a claim that it has been fixed in Circuitpython, but that has not been verified.It has something to do with the SMUX. I cannot fix this. I WILL LEAVE THIS REPO ACTIVE BUT IT IS UNLIKELY THAT IT WILL BE FIXED.

7/20/25 THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH F4 THAT I AM LOOKING INTO. I'D RECOMMEND CHECKING BACK IN A FEW DAYS

A CircuitPython driver for the AMS AS7343 14-channel spectral sensor. This device provides high-resolution spectral measurements across the visible and near-infrared spectrum, making it ideal for:

- Color measurement and classification
- LED spectrum analysis
- Environmental light sensing
- Low-cost lab and educational tools

Description
-----------

The AMS AS7343 is a spectral sensor offering readings from approximately 380nm to 1000nm. It includes:

- 14 photodiode channels: F1–F8, FZ, FY, FXL, NIR, and CLR
- Adjustable gain (0.5x to 2048x)
- Integration time in microseconds
- Internal SMUX (sensor multiplexer) to cycle through photodiode sets
- I2C interface (address 0x39)

This driver provides methods to set gain/integration time, select SMUX modes, perform full or partial scans, and manage power settings.

Features
--------

- Full 14-channel spectral measurement using read_all()
- SMUX mode selection for visible, NIR, and extended bands
- Low-power mode and sleep-after-interrupt (SAI)
- Saturation threshold checking
- Compatible with CircuitPython and Adafruit BusDevice

Installation
------------

1. Download the CircuitPython library bundle from https://circuitpython.org/libraries
2. Copy the following into the `lib/` directory on your device:
   - `as7343.py` (from this repo)
   - `adafruit_bus_device` (from the bundle)

Usage Example
-------------

.. code-block:: python

    import board
    import as7343
    import time

    i2c = board.STEMMA_I2C()
    sensor = as7343.AS7343(i2c)
    sensor.gain = as7343.GAIN_64X
    sensor.integration_time = 100000

    data = sensor.read_all()
    for ch, val in data.items():
        print(f"{ch}: {val}")

Advanced Use
------------

SMUX Read Example::

    sensor.read_smux_mode(as7343.SMUX_VISIBLE)
    sensor.read_smux_mode(as7343.SMUX_NIR)
    sensor.read_smux_mode(as7343.SMUX_FZF5)

Power Management::

    sensor.enable_low_power_mode(True)
    sensor.enable_sleep_after_interrupt(True)
    sensor.shutdown()
    sensor.wake()

Threshold Check::

    alerts = sensor.check_thresholds(60000)
    for ch, value in alerts:
        print(f"High reading: {ch} = {value}")

Supported Channels
------------------

- F1, F2, F3, F4 – Violet to green (405–515 nm)
- FY, F5 – Green/yellow (~555–560 nm)
- F6, F7, F8 – Red to deep red (640–745 nm)
- FZ, FXL – Additional narrowbands (450, 600 nm)
- NIR – Near infrared (~855 nm)
- CLR – Clear (broadband)
